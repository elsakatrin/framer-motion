I made a gallery site where you can see all the projects from this year that have been recommended to gallery. 
I used UseState. UseState is a hook that lets you add react state (data or properties) to function components. It allows you to track state in a function components.

I used useEffect, useEffect is the hook tahat managesthe side-effects in functional components. Side effect is f.ex. fetching data. 

I used async/await so when I open the page and the API is still loading I allow the page to continue loading without waiting for the API to get ready. So The API is waiting. 

Fetch allowed me to get the API out and I used the gallery.json to turn it into an array. 

I made a function where if there's a error another image shows up, that's why there is so many of the same image on the page.


My Component is a modal window and is on a different js file, inside the component folder.
The modal window has two functions, it's open and close. It opens on click and then if we click the X it closes again. 

Click the names on the cards to open the modal window! :)
